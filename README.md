# Quibbles

A personal project to alleviate annoyances from the GNOME shell, particularly when used with the superb [PaperWM](https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM) window manager

## Description

The user can:

- **Trim the Window Context Menu**
  - Remove items from the title bar context menu. Useful when used with a tiling window manager that doesn't have some concepts.
- **Get rid of the Overview**
  - Make the stock workspace indicator button unclickable or replace the stock indicator with a custom version that leads directly to hidden workspaces. Customizable to accommodate multiple visible workspaces and layouts.
- **Eliminate the mouse barrier to the right of the quick settings icons**
  - Please note that once the mouse barrier is removed, it cannot be restored without restarting the user session.
- **Change the lockscreen clock font and size**
  - Improve the lockscreen appearance with a simple change.
- **Unblank the lockscreen**
  - Used with attribution from the excellent [Unblank lock screen](https://github.com/sunwxg/gnome-shell-extension-unblank) by Xiaoguang Wang.
- **Add shortcuts to the system icon row in the Quick Settings menu**
  - Used with attribution from a longtime favorite [Tweaks & Extensions in System Menu](https://github.com/F-i-f/tweaks-system-menu) by Philippe Troin (F-i-f).
