# Quibbles

A personal project to remove annoyances from the GNOME shell

## Description

The user can:

- **Trim the Window Context Menu**
  - Remove items from the context menu
- **Get rid of the Overview**
  - Make the stock workspace indicator button unclickable
  - Replace the stock indicator with a custom version that leads directly to hidden workspaces
- **Eliminate the mouse barrier to the right of the quick settings icons**
  - There's no stopping you now!
	- *Please note that once the mouse barrier is removed, it cannot be restored without restarting the user session. Disable the **option**, log out, and log back in to restore the barrier.*
	- *Toggling the extension on and off twice will crash the shell if the mouse barrier has been destroyed in the current user session. This cannot be worked around.*
